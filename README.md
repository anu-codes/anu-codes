- 👋 Hi, I’m Anoushka @itsanoushkab
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently self learning Java, C/C++, DSA
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web application development
- 📫 Let's connect via twitter! I go by @itsanoushkab


I'm focussed on learning general purpose programming languages and want to develop web applications. 
I also learn/practice html, css, javascript, typescript, mysql, python, designing and hardware for college classes.

When I'm not coding, I like to read classic lit, play guitar, make spotify playlists and learn french :D
